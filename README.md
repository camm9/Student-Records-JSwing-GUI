# Create A GUI Where Student Records Can Be Accessed And Eligible Grades Can Be Changed
## Assignment 4 - CSIS 2175

This program uses JSwing to create a GUI where the user can read student records from a Access database table. The records are organized according to name and student number. Once a student is selected, the user can see the records for each course the student took. Courses with an "NA" grade can be edited to the correct grade.
